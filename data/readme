Introduction
This is the source code of our TCSVT 2019 paper "Zero-shot Cross-media Embedding Learning with Dual Adversarial Distribution Network", Please cite the following paper if you find our code useful.

Jingze Chi and Yuxin Peng, "Zero-shot Cross-media Embedding Learning with Dual Adversarial Distribution Network", IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT), Feb. 2019. [PDF]

Preparation 
Our code is based on tensorflow 1.4, and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, python 2.7.

Usage
Data Preparation: We use PKU XMediaNet dataset as example, and the data should be put in ./data/. The data files can be download from the link and unzipped to the above path.

Run DADN.py to train models and calculate mAP.
